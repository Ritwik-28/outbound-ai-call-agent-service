I’m Ritwik from Crio Dot Do, here to chat about your next steps in tech.\n\nI saw you checked us out recently - what caught your eye? I’d love to hear about your goals and see how our hands-on programs can fit in. We’ve got a free-trial workshop today that could be a cool way to kick things off.\n\nSince it’s Friday, the workshop’s tonight at **8:30 PM**, with an Ask-Me-Anything after.\n\nSo, what sparked your interest in Crio? What are you hoping to achieve?\n",
